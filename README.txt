FEATURES:

  Hi-res earth image data, mapped without any weird artifacts at the top or bottom.
  
  Geo-sphere in place of the usual quad-composed boring spheres that everybody has.  My sphere has no co-planar triangles, creating a smoother look for less (R)
  
  Atmosphere effect around the planet, in the form of a shader that is applied to the same geometry and could be applied to any closed geometry for a nice looking effect.
  
  Mathematically generated clouds using a triangular noise algorithm, provided only with normal data as input.
  
  Skybox (triangle) showing a space scene in the background (hand-made with Gimp)
  
  My signature schmoozy camera controls for a nice 'feel,' including controls for zoom and 3d pan.
  
  animation controls to speed up, slow down, or even reverse the physics timestep in a deterministic way.  Spacebar to play/pause, square brackets to slow, speedup.
  
  specular effects based on material - all water on the earth appears shiny, earth and clouds do not.
  
  clouds appear to move above the earth's surface due to some lighting tricks
